        <p><strong>Hockey</strong> is a family of sports in which two teams play against each other by trying
        to maneuver a ball or a puck into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. In many areas,
        one sport (typically field hockey or ice hockey) is generally referred to simply as hockey.</p>

        <h2 id="history">History of Hockey</h2>
        <p>Games played with curved sticks and a ball can be found in the histories of many cultures. In Egypt, 4000-year-old
        carvings feature teams with sticks and a projectile, hurling dates to before 1272 BC in Ireland, and there is a
        depiction from approximately 600 BC in Ancient Greece where the game may have been called kerētízein or kerhtízein
        (κερητίζειν) because it was played with a horn or horn-like stick(kéras, κέρας) In Inner Mongolia,
        the Daur people have been playing beikou, a game similar to modern field hockey, for about 1,000 years.</p>

            <h3 id="ice">Ice Hockey</h3>
            <p><strong>Ice hockey</strong> is played on a large flat area of ice, using a three-inch-diameter (76.2 mm) vulcanized rubber disc
            called a puck. This puck is often frozen before high-level games to decrease the amount of bouncing and
            friction on the ice. The game is contested between two teams of skaters. The game is played all over North
            America, Europe and in many other countries around the world to varying extent. It is the most popular sport
            in Canada, Finland, Latvia, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia.</p>

            <h3 id="field">Field Hockey</h3>
            <p><strong>Field hockey</strong> is played on gravel, natural grass, sand-based or water-based artificial turf, with a small,
            hard ball approximately 73 mm (2.9 in) in diameter. The game is popular among both males and females in many
            parts of the world, particularly in Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Argentina.
            In most countries, the game is played between single-sex sides, although they can be mixed-sex.</p>

            <h3 id="roller">Roller Hockey</h3>
            <p><strong>Roller hockey</strong> is a variation of roller hockey very similar to ice hockey, from which it is derived. Inline
            hockey is played by two teams, consisting of four skaters and one goalie, on a dry rink divided into two
            halves by a center line, with one net at each end of the rink. The game is played in three 15-minute periods
            with a variation of the ice hockey off-side rule. Icings are also called, but are usually referred to as
            illegal clearing. For rink dimensions and an overview of the rules of the game, see IIHF Inline Rules
            (official rules). Some leagues and competitions do not follow the IIHF regulations, in particular USA Inline
            and Canada Inline.</p>

            <h3 id="street">Street Hockey</h3>
            <p><strong>Street hockey</strong> also known as road hockey, this is a dry-land variant of ice and roller hockey played on a hard surface
            (usually asphalt). Most of the time, a ball is used instead of a puck, and generally no protective equipment
            is worn. Street hockey is played year round.</p>
